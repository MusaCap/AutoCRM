```markdown
As an SDR,
I want the dialer to auto-call leads from my CRM list,
So I can focus on conversations, not admin tasks.

As a sales manager,
I want to see call metrics by rep and campaign,
So I can coach and optimize team performance.

As a user,
I want to pause or skip contacts in the queue,
So I can avoid duplicates or bad leads.
